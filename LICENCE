If however, which God forbid, anyone puffed up with the pride of
arrogance shall try to destroy or infringe this little document of my
agreement and confirmation, let him know that on the last and fearful
Day of Assembly when the trumpet of the archangel is clanging the
call and bodies are leaving the foul graveyards, he will burn with
Judas the committer of impious treachery on the altar of the
cross in eternal confusion in the devouring flames of blazing
torments in punishments without end.
